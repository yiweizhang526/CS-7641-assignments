# CS-7641-assignment2-randomized-optimization
This is for Yiwei Zhang's assignment 2.

The assignment 2 is written in Python 3.7 in Windows 10 OS.

Datasets and codes can be found here.

1. Library dependencies:
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
mlrose-hiive

2. Dataset
For the neural network weighting part, I used Wine Quality Dataset, It can be downloaded from UCI machine learning repository.
The download url:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

3. user guide:
The dataset file is 'winequality.csv'. This is for Neural Network.ipynb.

There are 4 ipynb files.
4 peaks.ipynb: randomized optimization algorithms for four peaks problem
nqueens.ipynb: randomized optimization algorithms for N queens problem
flipflop.ipynb: randomized optimization algorithms for flipflop problem
Neural Network.ipynb: gradient descent and randomized optimization algorithms for MLP

The codes can be run in jupyter notebook (anaconda3).
