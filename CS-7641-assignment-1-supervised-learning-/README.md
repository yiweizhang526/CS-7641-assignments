# CS-7641-assignment-1-supervised-learning-
This is for Yiwei Zhang's machine learning assignment.

The assignment 1 is written in Python 3.7 in Windows 10 OS.

1. Library dependencies:
scikit-learn 0.19.1
numpy 1.13.3
pandas 0.20.3
matplotlib 2.1.0
graphviz 2.38.0
pandas==1.1.3
matplotlib==3.3.2
numpy==1.19.2
scikit_learn==1.0

2. Datasets
As I mentioned in the report, this datasets were preprocessed. I put the datasets I used in the github repository.
The original datasets are Statlog (German Credit Data) Data Set and Wine Quality Data Set (white). They can be downloaded from UCI machine learning repository.

The download url:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

3. user guide:
The two dataset files are 'winequality.csv' and 'credit.csv'.

There are 5*2 python files in two directories.
In Credit: DecisionTree_credit.py, ensemble_credit.py, KNN_credit.py, NN_credit.py, SVM_credit.py, 
In Wine: DecisionTree_wine.py, ensemble_wine.py, KNN_wine.py, NN_wine.py, SVM_wine.py, 

The codes are organized as classes and functions. It can run directly.
